title: Rrestock alert model
---
# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the restock alert model feature.

The feature introduces a schema for managing restock alerts in the database.

We will cover:

1. Why we need a restock alert model.
2. The structure of the restock alert schema.
3. How default values are set for certain fields.

# Why we need a restock alert model

The restock alert model is necessary to keep track of products that need restocking. It helps in managing inventory by alerting when stock levels are low.

# The structure of the restock alert schema

<SwmSnippet path="/models/Restocks_alert.js" line="3">

The schema defines the structure of the restock alert documents in the database. It includes fields for the product reference, current stock level, reason for the alert, alert date, and resolution status.

```
/**
 * Restocks Alert Schema defines the structure of the Restocks Alert documents in the database.
 *
 * @typedef {Object} RestocksAlert
 * @property {String} ref_product - The reference identifier for the product associated with the alert.
 * @property {Number} current_level - The current stock level of the product.
 * @property {String} reason - The reason for the alert.
 * @property {Date} alert_date - The date the alert was created, defaulting to the current date and time.
 * @property {Boolean} resolve - Indicates whether the alert has been resolved, defaulting to false.
 */
const restocksAlertSchema = mongoose.Schema({
    ref_product: String,
    current_level: Number,
    reason: String,
    alert_date: {type: Date, default: Date.now},
    resolve: {type: Boolean, default: false},
})
```

# How default values are set for certain fields

The <SwmToken path="/models/Restocks_alert.js" pos="10:10:10" line-data=" * @property {Date} alert_date - The date the alert was created, defaulting to the current date and time.">`alert_date`</SwmToken> field defaults to the current date and time, ensuring that each alert has a timestamp. The <SwmToken path="/models/Restocks_alert.js" pos="11:10:10" line-data=" * @property {Boolean} resolve - Indicates whether the alert has been resolved, defaulting to false.">`resolve`</SwmToken> field defaults to `false`, indicating that new alerts are unresolved by default.
