# RetailHub Backend

RetailHub is a stock management backend that integrates inventory predictions using AI and provides RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, sales, and customers.

```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd retailhub-backend
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server using `nodemon` (for automatic restarts during development):
   ```bash
   nodemon server
   ```

## Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```
2. Start the services (MongoDB and Node.js server):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Other Considerations

- **JWT Authentication**: This project uses JSON Web Token for user authentication. Ensure that your environment variables (e.g., `JWT_SECRET`) are correctly set.
- **AI Predictions**: The backend integrates with OpenAI to provide product demand forecasts. Ensure that the necessary API keys are configured.
