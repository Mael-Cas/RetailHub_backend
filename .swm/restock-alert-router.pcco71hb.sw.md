title: Restock alert router
---
# Introduction

This document will walk you through the implementation of the restock alert route feature.

The feature introduces new routes for handling restock alerts, including fetching, updating, deleting, and AI-based predictions.

We will cover:

1. How the routes are defined.
2. The purpose of each route.
3. The reasoning behind the AI prediction route.

# Defining the routes

We define the routes in <SwmPath>[routers/Restock_alert.js](/routers/Restock_alert.js)</SwmPath>. Each route corresponds to a specific action related to restock alerts.

To fetch all alerts:

```
router.get('/', AlertCtrl.GetAllAlerts);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/routers/Restock_alert.js" line="9">

---

To fetch a single alert by its ID:

```
router.get('/:id', AlertCtrl.GetOneAlerts);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/routers/Restock_alert.js" line="11">

---

To update an alert by its ID:

```
router.put('/:id', AlertCtrl.UpdateAlerts);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/routers/Restock_alert.js" line="12">

---

To delete an alert by its ID:

```
router.delete('/:id', AlertCtrl.DeleteAlerts);
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

# AI prediction route

<SwmSnippet path="/routers/Restock_alert.js" line="14">

---

We also introduce a route for AI-based predictions. This route allows us to call an AI service to predict restock needs.

```
router.post('/ai', AlertCtrl.CallIaPrediction)
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

This route is crucial for leveraging AI to improve inventory management by predicting restock requirements.
